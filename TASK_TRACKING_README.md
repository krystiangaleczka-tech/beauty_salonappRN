# Task Tracking System

## Overview

This directory contains a set of markdown task lists for tracking the development progress of the CreateXYZ project. These files follow the GitHub-flavored markdown checkbox syntax and are organized according to the best practices outlined in the project guidelines.

## Task List Files

- **PROJECT_TASK_LIST.md**: Main project task list with a high-level overview of all development areas
- **MOBILE_APP_TASKS.md**: Detailed tasks for the mobile app (Expo/React Native) development
- **WEB_API_TASKS.md**: Detailed tasks for the web app and API development

## How to Use These Task Lists

### Tracking Progress

1. **Mark tasks as complete** by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when a task is finished
2. **Update progress percentages** at the top of each file as tasks are completed
3. **Add new tasks** as they are identified, placing them in the appropriate section
4. **Move completed tasks** to the "Completed" section to maintain a clean view of current work

### Task Prioritization

Tasks are tagged with priority indicators:
- `#priority`: High-priority tasks that should be addressed first
- `#testing`: Testing-related tasks
- `#docs`: Documentation tasks

### Task Organization

Each task list is organized into sections:
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
- **Upcoming Tasks**: Tasks planned for future implementation
- **Completed**: Tasks that have been finished
- **Notes & Resources**: Relevant information and links

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Update the task lists at least daily to reflect current progress
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Use nested tasks to show dependencies and subtasks
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting throughout all task lists
4. **Link Resources**: Add links to relevant documentation or code files when applicable
5. **Track Progress**: Update the progress percentage at the top of each file

## Integration with Development Workflow

1. **Review during standups**: Use these task lists during daily standups to discuss progress
2. **Update after completing work**: Mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing them
3. **Plan sprints**: Use the Upcoming Tasks sections to plan future development cycles
4. **Track blockers**: Add notes to tasks that are blocked or waiting on dependencies

## Example Task Format

```markdown
- [ ] Implement feature X #priority
  - [x] Create component structure
  - [ ] Add functionality
  - [ ] Write tests
  - [ ] Document usage
```

This format shows a main task with subtasks, where one subtask has been completed.
