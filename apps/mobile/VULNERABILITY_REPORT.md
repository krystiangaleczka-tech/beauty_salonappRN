# Vulnerability Report for Mobile App

## Summary

A security audit was conducted on the mobile application dependencies. The audit identified several vulnerabilities of varying severity levels. This report documents the findings and the actions taken to address them.

## Vulnerabilities Found

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **form-data (4.0.0 - 4.0.3)**
   - **Issue**: Uses unsafe random function for choosing boundary
   - **CVE**: [GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4)
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed by running `npm audit fix --force`

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **node-fetch (<2.6.7)**
   - **Issue**: Forwards secure headers to untrusted sites
   - **CVE**: [GHSA-r683-j2x4-v87g](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r683-j2x4-v87g)
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed by running `npm audit fix --force`

### Low Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **tmp (<=0.2.3)** - Used by patch-package
   - **Issue**: Allows arbitrary temporary file/directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter
   - **CVE**: [GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6)
   - **Status**: ⚠️ No direct fix available
   - **Action Taken**: Updated patch-package to latest version (8.1.0-canary.1), but the vulnerability persists as it's a dependency of patch-package

## Actions Taken

1. Ran `npm audit fix --force` to fix critical and high severity vulnerabilities
2. Updated patch-package to the latest version (8.1.0-canary.1) using `npm install patch-package@8.1.0-canary.1 --save-dev --legacy-peer-deps`

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor patch-package Updates**: Keep an eye on patch-package updates that might address the tmp vulnerability in future releases
2. **Consider Security Implications**: The low severity vulnerability in tmp is related to symbolic link handling. In most mobile app development contexts, this poses minimal risk, but be aware of it if your build process involves handling untrusted inputs
3. **Regular Security Audits**: Continue to run `npm audit` regularly to identify and address new vulnerabilities
4. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions

## Conclusion

The critical and high severity vulnerabilities have been successfully addressed. The remaining low severity vulnerability in the tmp package (used by patch-package) has no direct fix available at this time. The overall security posture of the application has been significantly improved.
